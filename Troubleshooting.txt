Error#1
Erro when typing git push -u origin master
403 Forbidden while accessing https

Github seems only supports ssh way to read&write the repo, although https way also displayed 'Read&Write'.
So you need to change your repo config on your PC to ssh way:

edit .git/config file under your repo directory
find url=entry under section [remote "origin"]
change it from url=https://MichaelDrogalis@github.com/derekerdmann/lunch_call.git to url=ssh://git@github.com/derekerdmann/lunch_call.git. that is, change all the texts before @ symbol to ssh://git
Save config file and quit. now you could use git push origin master to sync your repo on GitHub

Error #2
in some macs the following error can ocurred when typing git clone:
"xcrun: error: invalid active developer path"
this is beacuse one needs to explicitly agree to the license agreement.

To solve this open Terminal, and run the following:
xcode-select --install
This will download and install xcode developer tools and fix the problem.
You do not need Xcode, you can install only the Command Line Tools here, it is about 130Mb.
