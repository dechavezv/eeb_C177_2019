**Note**: all instructions in this document are derived from [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/). Your virtualbox already has the latest version of Git installed, so you can skip step 1 of the "Setting up Git" section.

### Setting up git locally

Boot up your virtualbox and launch a terminal. You should be in the home directory- verify this by using `pwd` (i.e. "*P*ath of current *W*orking *D*irectory).

Before we use Git for the first time, we need to tell it our name and email address. This allows your commits to have an author and a contact- for example, here is a screenshot of one of DAniels's repository:

![]({{ site.url }}/images/git-screenshot.png)


You can set up your name and email address with the following commands in the terminal:

`git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"`
`git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"`


You can now use Git to do version control locally through your command line- hurray! To start using Git, use your terminal to navigate to the Desktop using the `cd` (i.e. "change directory") command and create a new `eeb-177` folder using `mkdir` (i.e. make directory). **Note**: some of you may have done this step already if you were following along in lecture on Tuesday:

`cd Desktop`
`mkdir eeb-177`
Then, you can switch into the newly made folder by using `cd eeb-177`.

If you had already made the `eeb-177` folder during lecture, simply navigate to it (i.e. `cd Desktop`; then `cd eeb-177`).

Within this folder, you will now make a "lab-work" folder that will include exercise you do during lab:

`mkdir lab-work`


Navigate into this new folder using `cd lab-work`, and confirm that you made it in by entering the command `pwd` (The output of `pwd` should be  `home/eeb177-student/Desktop/eeb-177/lab-work`). We want this folder to be tracked using git: for each weeks assignment, you are to make a new subfolder within this folder and use Git+Github to have the weekly subfolders pushed through to github.

To start tracking this folder using git, enter the following command:

`git init`

*Note*: this command only needs to be run when first setting up a new git repository.

It is good practice to initialize each git folder with a README file that explains the purpose of the repository. Create a README file in the homework folder with the command `touch README.txt`- this just creates an empty file. You can open this empty file using gedit (`gedit README.txt`). Edit this file to include your **name, year in college, computing experience, and lab section** for this course.

Next, we need to ask git to keep track of this file:
`git add README.txt`

Next we "commit" this file as a version we want saved in our history:

`git commit -m "initial commit: adding README file"`

*Note*: `-m` is a *flag* that says that this particular commit should be made with the message "initial commit: adding a barebones README file".


You can look over the (brief) history of your git repository by asking to see its log:

`git log`

### Getting Github to talk to your computer

You now have a functioning Git repository on your computer- hurray! Now, we need to connect it to your Github account so that the files and commit history on your computer can be "pushed" through to be available online.

Log into your account on github, and click "New repository" on the right hand column. Give it an appropriate name (it will contain assignments for this course), and keep it public. On the "Quick setup" page, make sure that "HTTPS" is selected- *not* "SSH". Copy the code under **"â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line"**, return to the terminal, and paste in the two lines. You will be prompted for a usern$

*Note*: As it stands, you will need to enter your username and password every time you wish to use `git push`. Run the following two commands in your terminal to store your credentials for one hour (i.e. you will have to enter your username/pwd once every hour):

Set git to use the credential memory cache:
`git config --global credential.helper cache`

Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds):
`git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'`

If you now navigate to your new repository on github, you should see your lab-work folder with the README file that you wrote. Congrats!


Sometimes we keep looking for resources everywhere only to realize that we had
it with us the whole time. Situation like these might arise when you have too
many choices. I too faced these moments before. It is a tough situation indeed.

I think one should develop art of learning before trying to learn a lot of
things at once. Once you know how to learn and improve how to learn through
constant iterations. It becomes easy thereafter.

I changed quite a lot as a developer and person. Last year. I was all about
learning new technologies, getting super aware about all the frameworks that
are popular. Now, I don't even bother checking these. My goals are now mostly
on low level decisions or high level architecture. All these frameworks and
likes are just tooling. Nothing less nothing more. The main focus should be on
problem solving. And problem solving at its heart is always
Language/Platform/Frameworks agnostic.

Reading books and theory is also very important at this stage. Consider it as
like sitting on the shoulder of giants. Of course practise is very important as
well but making sure there is a good balance between these two really pays off.

I love reading books. I have bought quite some books in the past 11 months. I
have so much to read and learn from these gems. I have done good progress in
completing some of these. Hoping to cover more in the near future.
