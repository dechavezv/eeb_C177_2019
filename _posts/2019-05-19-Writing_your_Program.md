Goals:
- Write all scripts for your program.

So by now you have the `core function` of your project figured out and you have `pseudocode` to tie the functions together.   

Today in discussion, you are going to work on the code that strings it all together.  

There is a folder on GitHub [here](https://github.com/pceeb/UCLA_Spring_2019/tree/master/Term_project/Example_scripts) that contains useful scripts that you can incorporate into your project.  

There is also a folder on GitHub [here](https://github.com/pceeb/UCLA_Spring_2019/tree/master/Term_project/Example_data) that includes example taxonomy data for the `fishbase` like projects.

# Just as a final friendly reminder:    

Your projects should be able to run on Hoffman2.

You will have the opportunity to tell us how much work you think that your teammate(s) did at the end of the project.  We will take that into consideration when grades are determined.  If you have been slacking, now is the time to make a change.

# Homework

Submit a new version of the program in this [repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/tu20JUgI). It should be more functional than the version submitted week 7. 
This is due before next discussion section.
