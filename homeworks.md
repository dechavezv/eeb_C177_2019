# Writing the Vignette

By now, the majority of your program finished.

To make your program as easy to use as possible, you are going to write a Vignette - the example "How to" for running your program. This should include text that explains how to run the program, example input and expected output files. See https://github.com/limey-bean/Anacapa/tree/New-Master/Example_data/ as an example.

Next week in discussion your peers are going to test out your programs and provide feedback.  They will need to be able to run your program and be able to verify that they got the expected output.  Your Vignette should provide everything they need to do this.

### Week9 and 10

# Looking Ahead

* Next week in Class:
  * Monday: Work on Projects
  * Wednesday: Present Projects

* Next week in Discussion:
  * Peer review of projects

* Projects Due:
  * __June 14th at Midnight__
  * No need to submit anything, we know where your repositories are....
  * Before submission, archive a version of your program in Zenodo https://zenodo.org/deposit/new
    * Download the final version of your repository and compress it.
    * Upload the compressed repository to Zenodo.  You will need to make an account first. Please follow Zenodo's instructions for uploading files.
    * After you submit your program, you will get a digital object identifier (DOI). ["This is a unique alphanumeric string assigned by a registration agency (the International DOI Foundation) to identify content and provide a persistent link to its location on the Internet.""](https://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/what-is-doi)
    * Add this DOI to your repository in a section called __Citing <your program name>__ so that people can cite your program if they use it.
    e.g.
    `
      __Citing ranacapa__
      doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1464285
    `

# _Just as a final friendly reminder:_

There is a folder on GitHub ```https://github.com/pceeb/UCLA_Spring_2019/tree/master/Term_project/Example_scripts``` that contains useful scripts that you can incorporate into your project.

There is also a folder on GitHub ```https://github.com/pceeb/UCLA_Spring_2019/tree/master/Term_project/Example_data``` that includes example taxonomy data for the 'fishbase' like projects.


Your projects should be able to run on Hoffman2.

You will have the opportunity to tell us how much work you think that your teammate(s) did at the end of the project.  We will take that into consideration when grades are determined.  If you have been slacking, now is the time to make a change.
